        <p>Q.b)What is a function. Why do we use functions?</p>
        <p>-> A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.</p>

        <p>Q.c)Explain the flow of execution when a function is called?</p>
        <p>-> A function call is like a detour in the flow of execution. Instead of going to the next statement, the flow jumps to the body of the function, executes all the statements there, and then comes back to pick up where it left off. You need to create a function before you can execute it.</p>
